One way transmition by udp protocol.

WhistleS -> is UDP-sender service.
WhistleR -> is UDP-receiver service.

There is another service: udp_buffer_regulator, which will help to avoid udp-packets loss on the UDP-receiver side.

You can run "fakeroot dpkg-deb --build whistleR" or "fakeroot dpkg-deb --build whistleS" to buid .deb packages.
